# Dice Challenge Project Description

The Dice Challenge project is a simple and engaging web application that simulates a dice game between two players. Each time the page is refreshed, the application rolls two dice and displays the result, indicating whether Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or if it is a draw. This project leverages HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and random number generation.

### HTML Structure:
The HTML file forms the backbone of the Dice Challenge, defining the layout of the game. It includes:
- A heading for the game title.
- Two sections to display the dice images for Player 1 and Player 2.
- A section to display the result of the dice roll (who wins or if it is a draw).

### CSS Styling:
CSS enhances the visual appeal of the Dice Challenge by styling the various elements. Key styling features include:
- Positioning and sizing of the dice images.
- Styling the game title and result message for better readability.

### JavaScript Logic:
JavaScript drives the interactivity and functionality of the Dice Challenge. Core functionalities include:
- Generating random numbers between 1 and 6 for each dice roll.
- Updating the dice images to reflect the rolled numbers.
- Comparing the dice rolls to determine and display the result.
- Refreshing the result on every page load to create a new game instance.

### Game Flow:
- Upon loading the page, JavaScript generates random numbers for two dice.
- The corresponding dice images are displayed for Player 1 and Player 2.
- The game logic compares the rolled numbers and updates the result message to show whether Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or if it is a draw.
- The page can be refreshed to play another round, providing a new outcome each time.

Overall, the Dice Challenge project is a fun and straightforward way to practice web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers a playful and interactive experience, simulating a simple dice game that determines a winner with each page refresh. Users can enjoy the randomness and simplicity of the game, making it a delightful exercise in basic web development concepts.
